Sagan is an open source, high performance, real-time log analysis & correlation
engine that run under *nix operating systems (Linux/FreeBSD/OpenBSD/etc).
It is written in C and uses a multi-threaded architecture to deliver high
performance log & event analysis. Sagan's structure and rules work similarly to
the Sourcefire/Cisco Snort or Suricata IDS/IPS engine. This was intentionally
done to maintain compatibility with rule management software
(oinkmaster/pulledpork/etc) and allows Sagan to correlate log events with your
Snort/Suricata IDS/IPS system. Sagan can also write to Snort IDS/IPS databases
via Unified2/Barnyard2. Sagan is compatible with all Snort/Suricata "consoles".
For example, Sagan is will work with Sguil ( http://sguil.sourceforge.net ),
BASE, the Prelude IDS framework ( https://www.prelude-ids.org )
and proprietary consoles! (to name a few).

Sagan supports many different output formats,
log normalization (via http://www.liblognorm.com), script execution on event
detection, automatic firewall support via "Snortsam", GeoIP detection/alerting,
multi-line log support (flowbit), time sensitive alerting and much more.
